# CPTR 142 Project III: Taco Bell Menu


Our proposal for this project is to create some sort of menu system for users that will make it easy for them to see all the nutritional 
facts of their order, live as its being ordered. We are considering basing this menu system off of Taco Bells. So that the users might 
choose to eat a little healthier while ordering fast food.

## Problem Definition

The goal for this project is to create a Taco Bell menu for users that mimics the actual menu ordering system but will add nutrional facts such as
Total Calories, Total Fats, Total Cholesterol, Total Sodium, Total Carbohydrates, and Total Proteins. This will help solve the problem of
eating too many unhealthy foods or reducing the odds of obtaining obseity or heart dieseases later on in life.


### Key Features
* Complete Menu Ordering System
* Nutritional facts calculator
* Can switch between any food categories and will remember order at anytime

### Assumptions

We assume the users of this menu system, with a nutrition calcultor, will be people who really care about their daily diet.
